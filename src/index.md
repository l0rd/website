Hello! I’m a software engineer, architect, and open-source contributor.

I’m currently a **Senior Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat**, where I work
on container-based developer tools like Podman and cloud development
environments and help shape open-source ecosystems. I’ve served as a **CNCF
Ambassador**, been the technical lead for the **Eclipse Che** project, and
co-created the Devfile specification — work that spans container orchestration,
tooling, and extensible cloud environments. I’ve spoken at major industry events
such as **KubeCon**, **FOSDEM**, and JavaOne on topics including Kubernetes,
container security, and scalable development platforms.

<!--
My expertise includes designing and scaling distributed systems, advancing
container and Kubernetes technologies, influencing engineering practices across
teams, and mentoring engineers to build resilient, high-performance solutions.
I’m passionate about improving developer workflows and empowering engineers to
deploy and operate cloud-native applications with reliability and efficiency — a
mission that aligns with the responsibilities of a Principal Engineer focused on
containers and container orchestration in a cloud platform context.
